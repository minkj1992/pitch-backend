`Pitch` service is a service that helps team members work efficiently.
It is a service that allows team members to share clear tasks and work while listening to shared `labor songs` for a short period of about **1 to 3 hours**. 

It will be especially useful after lunchtime, when everyone is tired, or where there is a clear goal, such as a hackathon.
